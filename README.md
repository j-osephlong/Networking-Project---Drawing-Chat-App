# Networking-Project---Drawing-Chat-App

## To run

Make sure you have the proper python dependencies installed. (PyJWT, Flask, flask_socketio, sqlite3, ...)

Run 'python colo.py' to start the server. This will make the app accessible to devices on your network under you local IP.

To make the server public outside of your local network, port forward your device under port 5000 for both TCP and UDP.
